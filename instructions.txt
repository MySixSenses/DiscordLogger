How to use this bot:
1. Go to Discord > User Settings > Appearance > Advanced > Turn Developer Mode On
2. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications > New Application > Bot > Add Bot > Copy API Token 
WARNING: Don't give anyone your token. It will allow them to control your bot.
3. Go to logger.py and paste your API Token into where it says client.run(" ") with the quotes on
4. If you don't have discord.py installed go to the Command Prompt and cd to your Scripts folder in the same folder as Python. Then install discord.py by typing pip install discord
5. Go to the Discord Server where you want the bot to log everything
6. Click on the channel where you would like the bot to log everything and copy the Channel ID into the line where it says     channel = client.get_channel("Replace this with the ID of the Audit channel") without the quotes
Then invite your bot to your server by going to https://discord.com/developers/applications and clicking on your bot > OAuth2 > Choose bot as your scope > Choose Admin for permissions > Go up to scopes and copy the invite link and invite it to the server that you want to audit.
NOTE: You can only use 1 server for 1 bot. If you have more than one server where you need this, you must repeat 1-9.
